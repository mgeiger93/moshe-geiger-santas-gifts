# Home assignment - Santa's gifts.
Thank you for concidering me to join your company.
Things I wish I had time to add to make this a better app:
 - Gift request API should have full CURD accessability.
 - Product (gift) catalog should have a RESTfull API of its own.
 - Better separation of services in the business logic.
 - Adding a separate Dependency-Injection project. The API layer should not reference DAL.
 - Extracting some of the more complicated logic to methods for better readability.
